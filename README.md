# CloudDBSample
A sample cloud database with SQLite and NodeJS

# Dependencies
This project makes use of [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/).

For the purposes of quick testing, I've included the `node-modules` folder in the project so installing additional packages isn't needed.

Primary.db is being used as the primary database. It is a copy of Evaluation_database_UNIT1.db.

# Running
Open a terminal or Command Prompt on the root of the directory and run `node server.js`. In a browser, head on over to http://localhost:8080.
